# FOLDER_PURPOSE.md

*Write any number of Java interface types in the folder doc/plan/plan, in appropriate packages, to
 represent your APIs. These must be Java code files that compile and contain extensive comments
  to explain the purpose of each interface and each declared method (this basic code can be
   actually be generated directly from a UML diagram). Include any Exceptions you plan to throw
    because of errors that might occur within these methods. Note, this does not require that all
     of these types will remain as interfaces in the final implementation, just that the goal is
      for you to focus on each type's behavior and purpose rather than its state.*
