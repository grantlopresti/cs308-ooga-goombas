# FOLDER_PURPOSE.md

*Put any materials specifically for your presentation in the folder doc/progress1, either as code
, images, UML diagrams, or written text, using Markdown, Javadoc or a wiki page on Gitlab
. PowerPoint slides are discouraged because they are completely separate from the project and
 unlikely to be maintained even if they are added to the repository, but here are some tools to
  convert Markdown to a slide style format.*
