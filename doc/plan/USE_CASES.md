# USE_CASES.md

*In another file, USE_CASES.md, write at least 8 use cases per person on your team that describe
 specific features you expect to complete. Focus on those features you plan to complete during
  the first two sprints (i.e., the next two weeks â€” the project's highest priority features
  ). Note, they can be similar to those given in the assignment specification, but should include
   more details based on your project's goals.*
