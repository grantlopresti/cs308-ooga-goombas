# FOLDER_PURPOSE.md

*Pick at least 5 use cases and provide example "implementations" of them, in the folder doc/plan
/usecases, using only methods declared in your code interfaces. Note, these should be Java code
 files that compile and contain extensive comments explaining how you expect your different APIs
  to collaborate. Feel free to implement each use case either in a single class to show how the
   steps are connected "procedurally" or in separate classes that implement the necessary
    interfaces to show how the steps are "distributed" across the objects. In either case, make
     it clear which how the implementation relates to the use case. You will likely need to
      create simple "mocked up" objects that implement your interfaces so you have something
       concrete to create, using new, and call methods on.*
