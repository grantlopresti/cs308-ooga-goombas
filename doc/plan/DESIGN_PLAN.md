# DESIGN_PLAN.md

*Write your planned design in a single file, DESIGN_PLAN.md, as described below. Note, this file
 can link to external image files (such as UML diagrams, CRC cards, scans of hand drawn diagrams
 , example game screens, etc.).*
 
##

## Introduction
*This section describes the problem your team is trying to solve by writing this program, the
 primary design goals of the project (i.e., where is it most flexible), and the primary
  architecture of the design (i.e., what is closed and what is open). Discuss the design at a
   high-level (i.e., without referencing specific classes, data structures, or code).*
   
## Overview
*This section serves as a map of your design for other programmers to gain a general
 understanding of how and why the program was divided up, and how the individual parts work
  together to provide the desired functionality. Describe specific modules you intend to create
  , their purpose with regards to the program's functionality, and how they collaborate with each
   other, focusing specifically on each one's API. Include a picture of how the modules are
    related (these pictures can be hand drawn and scanned in, created with a standard drawing
     program, or screen shots from a UML design program). Discuss specific classes, methods, and
      data structures, but not individual lines of code.*
      
## Design Details
*This section describes each module introduced in the Overview in detail (as well as any other
 sub-modules that may be needed but are not significant to include in a high-level description of
  the program). Describe how each module's API handles specific features given in the assignment
   specification, what resources it might use, how it collaborates with other modules, and how
    each could be extended to include additional requirements (from the assignment specification
     or discussed by your team). Finally, justify the decision to create each module with respect
      to the design's key goals, principles, and abstractions.*
      
## Example games
*Describe three example games that differ significantly in detail. Clearly identify how the
 functional differences in these games is supported by your design. Use these examples to help
  clarify the abstractions in your design.*
  
## Design Considerations
*This section describes any issues which need to be addressed or resolved before attempting to
 devise a complete design solution. Include any design decisions discussed at length (include
  pros and cons from all sides of the discussion) as well as any ambiguities, assumptions, or
   dependencies regarding the program that impact the overall design.*
