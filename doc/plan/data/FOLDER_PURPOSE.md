# FOLDER_PURPOSE.md

*Write any number of example data files needed to represent one, simple, game in the folder doc
/plan/data. The goal of these example files is to help the team agree on standard locations and
 formats for your shared data (such as property files for configurations within your Java code
 , your team's chosen file format for representing game data, and other asset files like HTML
  pages, images, or sounds). Note, your example does not need to be exhaustive, just
   representative of the file's format.*
